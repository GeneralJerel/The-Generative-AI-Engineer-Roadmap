Once you are done with the basics, you need to learn how to give your LLM System Arms and Legs, what better way of doing so than Function Calling
 
- Learn to extend LLMs with custom functionality via function-calling, enabling them to form calls to external functions.
- Extract structured data from natural language inputs, making real-world data usable for analysis.
- Build an end-to-end application that processes customer service transcripts using LLMs.
